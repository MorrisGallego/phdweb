# MyPhDPortfolio

This is a very simple landing page for showing my PhD portfolio. 

You can use it freely.

Currently data can only be read from GitHub. 
In the future I will also add support for reading it from other sources (as GitLab).

You can customize the app modifying the variables in .env

This app has been developed using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), so follow their instructions for deployments.
